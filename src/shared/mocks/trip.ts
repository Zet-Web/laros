    'The Peloponnese is visited by thousands of tourists every year, mainly because of the numerous archaeological sites and excavations. As a result, real tourist roads have been created. In the interior, numerous dreamy mountain villages are still almost completely untouched. Discover the fascinating landscapes, the numerous unknown sights and experience the warmth of the Greeks. On this round trip you will have the opportunity to visit some of the most important sights on the one hand, but on the other hand you will also get to know a world in which tourism does not yet play a role. copyright © laros.ch - 2015 / Copying contents of these pages i Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)',
